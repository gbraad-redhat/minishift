[[host-folders-overview]]
== Overview

Host folders are directories on the host which are shared between the host and the {project} VM.
They allow for a two way file synchronization between host and VM.
The following sections discuss the various types of host folders, driver provided host folders, as well as the `minishift hostfolder` command.

[[driver-host-folders]]
== Driver-Provided Host Folders

Some drivers mount a default host folder into the VM in order to share files between the VM and the host.
These folders are currently not configurable and differ for each driver and OS.

[[table-driver-host-folders]]
.Driver-provided host folders

|===
|Driver |OS |HostFolder |VM

|Virtualbox |Linux |/home |/hosthome

|Virtualbox |OSX |/Users |/Users

|Virtualbox |Windows |C://Users |/c/Users

|Xhyve |OSX |/Users |/Users
|===

[NOTE]
====
- Host folder sharing is not implemented in the KVM and Hyper-V drivers.
If you use one of these drivers, you need to use the `minishift hostfolder` command to set up and configure host folders.

- The VirtualBox default host folders are available only with the default Boot2Docker ISO.
It requires VirtualBox link:https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html[Guest Additions], which is currently unavailable in the CentOS ISO.
====

[[minishift-hostfolder-command]]
== {project} hostfolder Command

{project} provides the xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder`] command to list, add, mount, unmount and remove host folders.
In contrast to the driver-provided host folders, you can use the `hostfolder` command to mount multiple shared folders onto custom specified mount points.

[NOTE]
====
Currently only link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block[CIFS] is supported as a host folder type.
Support for link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS[SSHFS]-based host folders is in progress, as described in GitHub issue link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/317[#317].
If you want to manually set up SSHFS, see xref:sshfs-folder-mount[SSHFS Host Folders].
====

[[host-folder-prerequisite]]
=== Prerequisites

To use the `minishift hostfolder` command, you need to be able to share directories using CIFS.
On Windows, CIFS is the default technology for sharing directories.
For example, on Windows 10 the *_C:\Users_* folder is shared by default and can be accessed by locally-authenticated users.

It is also possible to use CIFS on macOS and Linux.
On macOS, you can enable CIFS-based shares under *System Preferences > Sharing*.
See link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204445[How to connect with File Sharing on your Mac] for detailed setup instructions.

On Linux, follow your distribution-specific instructions to install link:https://www.samba.org[Samba].

[[displaying-host-folders]]
=== Displaying Host Folders

The xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder_list.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder list`] command gives you an overview of the defined host folders, their names, mount points, remote paths and whether they are currently mounted.

An example output could look like:

----
$ minishift hostfolder list
Name        Mountpoint            Remote path              Mounted
myshare     /mnt/sda1/myshare     //192.168.1.82/MYSHARE   N
----

In this example, there is a host folder with the name *_myshare_* which mounts *_//192.168.1.82/MYSHARE_* onto *_/mnt/sda1/myshare_* in the {project} VM.
The share is currently not mounted.

NOTE: The remote path must be reachable from within the VM.
In the example above, *192.168.1.82* is the IP of host within the LAN, which is one option you can use.
You can use `ifconfig` (or `Get-NetIPAddress | Format-Table` on Windows) to determine a routable IP address.

[[adding-host-folders]]
=== Adding Host Folders

The xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder_add.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder add`] command allows you to define a new host folder.
This in an interactive process that queries the relevant details for a host folder based on CIFS.

[[adding-cifs-hostfolder]]
.Adding a CIFS based hostfolder
----
$ minishift hostfolder add myshare // <1>
UNC path: //192.168.99.1/MYSHARE   // <2>
Mountpoint [/mnt/sda1/myshare]:    // <3>
Username: john                     // <4>
Password: [HIDDEN]                 // <5>
Domain:                            // <6>
Added: myshare
----
<1> (Required) Actual `minishift hostfolder add` command that specifie a host folder with a name of *_myshare_*.
<2> (Required) The UNC path for the share.
<3> The mount point within the VM. The default is *_/mnt/sda1/<host folder name>_*.
<4> (Required) The user name for the CIFS share.
<5> (Required) The password for the CIFS share.
<6> The domain of the share. Often this can be left blank, but for example on Windows, when your account is linked to a Microsoft account, you must use the Microsoft account email address as user name as well as your machine name as displayed by `$env:COMPUTERNAME` as a domain.

TIP: On Windows hosts, the `minishift hostfolder add` command also provides a `users-share` option.
When this option is specified, no UNC path needs to be specified and the *_C:\Users_* is assumed.

WARNING: When you use the Boot2Docker ISO with the VirtualBox driver, VirtualBox guest additions are automatically enabled and occupy the *_/Users_* mount point.

[[instance-host-folders]]
==== Instance-Specific Host Folders

By default, host folder definitions are persistent, similar to other xref:../using/basic-usage.adoc#persistent-configuration[persistent configuration] options.
This means that these host folder definitions will survive the deletion and subsequent re-creation of a {project} VM.

In some cases you might want to define a host folder just for a specific {project} instance.
To do so, you can use the `instance-only` flag of the xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder_add.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder add`] command.
Host folder definition that are created with the `instance-only` flag will be removed together with any other instance-specific state during xref:../command-ref/minishift_delete.adoc#[`minishift delete`].

[[mounting-host-folders]]
=== Mounting Host Folders

After you add host folders, you use the xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder_mount.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder mount`] command to mount a host folder by its name:

----
$ minishift hostfolder mount myshare
Mounting 'myshare': '//192.168.99.1/MYSHARE' as '/mnt/sda1/myshare' ... OK
----

You can verify that the host folder is mounted by running:

----
$ minishift hostfolder list
Name       Mountpoint          Remote path              Mounted
myshare    /mnt/sda1/myshare   //192.168.99.1/MYSHARE   Y
----

Alternatively, you can list the actual content of the mounted host folder:

----
$ minishift ssh "ls -al /mnt/sda1/myshare"
----

[[auto-mounting-host-folders]]
==== Auto-Mounting Host Folders

Host folders can also be mounted automatically each time you run xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`].
To set auto-mounting, you need to set the `hostfolder-automount` option in the {project} configuration file.

----
$ minishift config set hostfolders-automount true
----

After the `hostfolders-automount` option is set, {project} will attempt to mount all defined host folders during `minishift start`.

[[umounting-host-folders]]
=== Unmounting Host Folders

You use the xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder_umount.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder umount`] command to unmount a host folder.

----
$ minishift hostfolder umount myshare
Unmounting 'myshare' ... OK

$ minishift hostfolder list
Name       Mountpoint          Remote path              Mounted
myshare    /mnt/sda1/myshare   //192.168.99.1/MYSHARE   N
----

[[deleting-host-folders]]
=== Deleting Host Folders

You use the xref:../command-ref/minishift_hostfolder_remove.adoc#[`minishift hostfolder remove`] command to remove a host folder definition.

----
$ minishift hostfolder list
Name        Mountpoint            Remote path              Mounted
myshare     /mnt/sda1/myshare     //192.168.1.82/MYSHARE   N

$ minishift hostfolder remove myshare
Removed: myshare

$ minishift hostfolder list
No host folders defined
----

[[sshfs-folder-mount]]
=== SSHFS Host Folders

NOTE: This host folder type is not supported by the `minishift hostfolder` command and requires manual configuration.

You can use SSHFS-based host folders if you have an SSH daemon running on your host.
Normally, this prerequisite is met by default on Linux and macOS.

Most Linux distributions have an SSH daemon installed. If not, follow the instructions for your specific distribution to install an SSH daemon.

macOS also has a built-in SSH server.
To use it, make sure that *Remote Login* is enabled in *System Preferences > Sharing*.

On Windows, you can install link:https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guide_windows_openssh_server[OpenSSH for Windows].

The following steps demonstrate how to mount host folders with SSHFS.

. Run `ifconfig` (or `Get-NetIPAddress` on Windows) to determine the local IP address from the same network segment as your {project} instance.

. Create a mountpoint and mount the shared folder.
+
----
$ minishift ssh "sudo mkdir -p /Users/<username>"
$ minishift ssh "sudo chown -R docker /Users"
$ minishift ssh
$ sshfs <username>@<IP>:/Users/<username>/ /Users
----

. Verify the share mount.
+
----
$ minishift ssh "ls -al /Users/<username>"
----
